### When I was beginning my journey in Frontend Development, I created my first website, a simple yet functional project that showcased my growing skills. The site featured a clean design with a focus on responsive layouts and user-friendly navigation. I built it using HTML, CSS, ensuring it was accessible across different devices and browsers. This project was a crucial learning experience that deepened my understanding of the core principles of web development, from coding practices to debugging. It marked the start of my passion for creating engaging and efficient user interfaces. :)
